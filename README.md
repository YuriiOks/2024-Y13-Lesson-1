# Coding Challenges Repository

## Overview
This repository contains coding challenges designed for educational purposes. It includes problems, solution templates, and automated tests to facilitate learning and assessment.

## Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `.github/workflows/`: Contains GitHub Actions workflow for autograding.
- `problems/`: Contains the problem statements in markdown format.
- `solutions/`: Contains template files for each problem where students can write their solutions.
- `tests/`: Contains test files to automatically check the solutions.

## Problems
1. **Symmetry of a Four-Digit Number**: Determine if a four-digit number is symmetrical.
2. **Maximum of Two Numbers Without Conditional Statements**: Find the larger of two numbers using only integer arithmetic operations.
3. **Division Without Remainder**: Check if one number is divisible by another without any remainder using only arithmetic operations.

## How to Use
- Students should fork this repository and complete their solutions in the provided template files under `solutions/`.
- Upon pushing their code, the GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/autograding.yml` will automatically run tests against their solutions.
- Results of these tests can be viewed in the Actions tab of their forked repository.

## Contributing
- Contributions to the problems or tests are welcome.
- Please ensure that any changes adhere to the existing structure and standards.
