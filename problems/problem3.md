# Problem 3: Division Without Remainder

## Description
In this task, you need to check if a number `a` is divisible by another number `b` without any remainder. You are allowed to use only arithmetic operations. The use of any forms of branching, functions, or loops is prohibited.

## Example

### Input
10
5

### Output
YES

## Task
Your program should take two integers, `a` and `b`, as input and output `YES` if `a` is divisible by `b` without a remainder, or `NO` otherwise. Remember, you can only use arithmetic operations to solve this problem; no conditional statements, functions, or loops are allowed.
