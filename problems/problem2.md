# Problem 2: Maximum of Two Numbers Without Conditional Statements

## Description
Write a program that reads two integers, `a` and `b`, and outputs the larger of the two numbers. The numbers are integers ranging from 1 to 1000. You must solve this problem using only integer arithmetic operations and without using any conditional statements, loops, or functions.

## Example

### Input
8
5

### Output
8

## Task
Your task is to develop a program that adheres to the above constraints. The program should take two integers as input and produce the larger of the two as output. Remember, the use of conditional statements, loops, or functions is not allowed; rely solely on integer arithmetic operations.
