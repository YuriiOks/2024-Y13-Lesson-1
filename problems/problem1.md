# Problem 1: Symmetry of a Four-Digit Number

## Description
Given a four-digit number, determine if its decimal representation is symmetrical. If the number is symmetrical, output `1`. Otherwise, output any other integer. The number may have fewer than four digits; in this case, assume that its decimal representation is padded with zeros on the left.

## Example

### Input
2002

### Output
1

## Task
Write a program that takes a four-digit (or fewer) number as input and checks for its symmetry as described above. The output should be `1` for a symmetrical number and any other integer for a non-symmetrical number.

Remember, the input will be given as a standard integer, so you might need to process it to check for symmetry.
